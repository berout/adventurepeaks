It's my very first front-end project. This is a full responsive website for mountain lovers who wants to learn about most popular world's peaks. You can also check current weather in popular mountain resorts. There are also trip and course offers if you want to discover beautiful places or learn new hiking skills. All images are downloaded from free photo banks. I took care about accessibility so there is a possibility to adjust font size to user's needs.
